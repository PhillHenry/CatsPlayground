/**
SystemFw â€” 02/27/2022
note that the details of harness don't really matter
you could have put each Stream element in Ref and then write a for or whatever
the idea behind it is quite simple though
write a test as if TestControl didn't exist
then, make it deterministic by running it with TestControl.executeEmbed
I tend to write them in a style where I write the program under test, the expected result, the
harnessing code (sometimes this is mixed with the program under test), and then the assertion
in this case, how would you test your code if you didn't have TestControl?
what I did was accumulate each intermediate result in the stream, and then tagging it with the time
at which it was produced
the program works without TestControl, but it's going to be slow (as in, wait 10 seconds), and fail
because it's not going to produce an output after exactly 5 seconds due to clock imprecision
then, you just run it with TestControl, and you're done
bonus point: you don't really need to learn anything specific to TestControl except that one function
